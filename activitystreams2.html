      <h2>Author's Note</h2>
      <p>
        This draft is heavily influenced by the JSON Activity
        Streams 1.0 specification originally co-authored by Martin
        Atkins, Will Norris, Chris Messina, Monica Wilkinson, Rob Dolin and
        James Snell.  The author is very thankful for their significant
        contributions and gladly stands on their shoulders.  Some portions of
        the original text of Activity Streams 1.0 are used in this document.
      </p>
    </section>

  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In the most basic sense, an "activity" is a semantic description of
      a potential or completed action.  In the former case, the activity
      expresses what can or might be done with a particular object, while 
      in the latter case, it expresses what has already been done.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is the goal of this specification to provide a JSON-based syntax
      that is sufficient to express metadata about activities in a rich,
      human-friendly, machine-processable and extensible manner.  This may
      include constructing natural-language descriptions or visual
      representations about the activity, associating actionable
      information with various types of objects, communicating or recording
      activity logs, or delegation of potential actions to other
      applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in [[!RFC2119]].
    </p>

    <section id="activitystreams-1.0" class="informative">

      <h2>Relationship to JSON Activity Streams 1.0</h2>

      <p>
        The JSON Activity Streams 1.0 [[!AS1]] specification was
        published in May of 2011 and provided a baseline extensible syntax
        for the expression of completed activities.  This specification
        builds upon that initial foundation by incorporating lessons learned
        through extensive implementation, community feedback and related 
        ongoing work from a variety of other communities.
      </p>

      <p>
        While the syntax defined by this specification diverges somewhat from
        that defined by JSON Activity Streams 1.0, the verbs, objectTypes,
        extensions and fundamental model defined by that original
        specification remain intact.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please refer to Section 6 for more detail about the differences between 
        the 1.0 and 2.0 syntax and for a listing of specific backwards
        compatibility requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        This specification incorporates several existing extensions to the
        1.0 syntax directly into the 2.0 model.  These include portions of
        the Activity Streams 1.0 Base Schema, Audience
        Targeting, Responses, and Priority extensions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="syntaxconventions">

      <h2>Syntax Conventions</h2>

      <p>
        This specification defines a JSON-based [[!RFC4627]] serialization
        syntax.
      </p>

      <p>
        When serialized, absent properties are represented by either (a)
        setting the property value to null, or (b) by omitting the property
        declaration altogether at the option of the publisher; these
        representations are semantically equivalent.  If a property has an
        array value, the absence of any items in that array MUST be
        represented by omitting the property entirely or by setting the value
        to null.
      </p>

      <p>
        This specification uses IRIs [[!RFC3987]].  Every URI [[!RFC3986]] is also
        an IRI, so a URI may be used wherever an IRI is named.  There are two
        special considerations: (1) when an IRI that is not also a URI is
        given for dereferencing, it MUST be mapped to a URI using the steps
        in Section 3.1 of [[!RFC3987]] and (2) when an IRI is serving as an "id"
        value, it MUST NOT be so mapped.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unless otherwise specified, all properties with date and time values
        MUST conform to the "date-time" production in [[!RFC3339]], with an
        uppercase "T" character used to separate date and time, and an
        uppercase "Z" character in the absence of a numeric time zone offset.
        All such timestamps SHOULD be represented relative to Coordinated
        Universal Time (UTC).
      </p>

        A <dfn title="Natural Language Value" id="nlv">Natural Language Value</dfn>
        is a representation of human-readable character sequences in one or more

        a JSON dictionary mapping [[RFC5646]] Language-Tags to localized, equivalent 
        translations of the same string value.
      </p>

      <p>
        For instance, the <code><a>displayName</a></code> property in all objects is 
        a Natural Language value.

      <p>
        Each key in the JSON dictionary MUST be an [[RFC5646]] Language-Tag.
        The associated values MUST be Strings.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="typeValues">
      <h2>Type Values</h2>

      <p>
        A <dfn title="Type Value">Type value</dfn> represents a reference to, 
        or descriptions of, an abstract type.  They are expressed as either: (1) a 
        String conforming to either the <code>isegment-nz-nc</code> or <code>IRI</code> 
        productions in [[!RFC3987]] or (2) an <a>Object</a>.  When represented as a String, 
        the use of relative references other than a simple name is not allowed.  When
        represented as an <a>Object</a>, the <code><a>id</a></code> property MUST be specified.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within the Activity Streams 2.0, Type values are used only by the
        <code><id>objectType</id></code> and <code><id>verb</id></code>
        properties.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <figcaption>Object type as a simple name (isegment-nz-nc):</figcaption>
<pre class="example highlight json">{
  "objectType": "person",

    "displayName": "Person"

}</pre></figure>

      <p>
        Because the second and third examples above each specify
        "<code>http://example.org/Person</code>", the two examples are 
        considered to specify the same type.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <figcaption>Verb as a simple name (isegment-nz-nc):</figcaption>
<pre class="example highlight json">{
  "verb": "post",

}</pre></figure>

      <p>
        Allowing verbs and object types to be represented as objects rather
        than simple names or IRIs is intended to simplify the use of
        extensions that an implementation might not have encountered
        previously.  The object properties provide additional information and
        metadata about the new verb or object type.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is important to note that because the <code><a>id</a></code> property 
        is strictly limited to absolute IRI values, the object representation cannot 
        be used to describe types with simple names.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="linkValues">
      <h2>Link Values</h2>

      <p>
        A <dfn title="Link Value" id="linkValue">Link Value</dfn> represents 
        a reference to one or more additional objects and resources.
        They are expressed as either: (1) a String containing an absolute or
        relative IRI, (2) an <a>Object</a>, or (3) a JSON Array
        containing a mixture of IRIs or <a title="Object">Objects</a>.  
        Link values are closely related to the conceptual model of Links 
        as established in [[!RFC5988]].
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, as defined previously, all <a title="Object">Objects</a> can
        contain an <code><a>image</a></code> property whose value describes a graphical
        representation of the containing object.  This property will
        typically be used to provide the URL to a JPEG, GIF or PNG type
        resource that can be displayed to the user.  Any given object might
        have multiple such visual representations -- multiple screenshots,
        for instance, or the same image at different resolutions.  Using Link
        values, there are essentially three ways of describing such
        references.
      </p>

      <p>
        To reference a single image without any additional metadata, the link
        value can be expressed as a simple JSON string containing an absolute
        or relative IRI:
      </p>

      <figure><figcaption></figcaption>
<pre class="example highlight json">{
  "objectType": "application",
  "id": "http://example.org/application/123",
  "displayName": "My Application",
  "image": "http://example.org/application/123.png"
}</pre></figure>

      <p>
        Alternatively, if additional metadata is required, the link can be
        expressed as an object containing the url property.
      </p>

      <figure><figcaption></figcaption>
<pre class="example highlight json">{
  "objectType": "application",
  "id": "http://example.org/application/123",
  "displayName": "My Application",

      <p>
        RFC 5988 defines that all Links have a "link relation" that describes
        the contextual purpose of the link.  Within an <a>Object</a>,
        in the absence of a specific <code><a>rel</a></code> property, the 
        name of the property whose value is a link serves as the "link relation".  
        Any valid link relation value, as defined by [[RFC5988]], can be used as 
        a property with a link value in any Activity Streams object, except where 
        the link relation might conflict with any other property defined by this 
        specification.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the following example, two separate links are provided.  The link
        relation of the first is "<code>image</code>", while the link relation of the
        second is "<code>preview</code>".  Both links, however, can be used as 
        alternative visual representations of the "<code>application</code>" object.

        Activity objects are specializations of the base <a>Object</a>

      </p>

      <p>
        Within an Activity object, the <code><a>verb</a></code> property 
        is used to identify the type of activity.  All existing verb 
        definitions used in JSON Activity Streams 1.0 implementations 
        can continue to be used and retain their existing semantics.  
        If the <code><a>verb</a></code> is not specified, the
        <code><a>objectType</a></code> property MAY be used as an alternative 
        means of determining the activity type.

        <h2>Considerations on the use of <code><a>priority</a></code></h2>

        <p>
          The presence of the <code><a>priority</a></code> property does not impose any 
          specific processing or display requirements on the part of any entity
          consuming the activity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Expressing the value as a range of numeric decimal values is intended
          to provide the greatest level of flexibility in the expression and
          consumption of prioritization detail.  It is expected that
          implementors consuming activity objects containing <code><a>priority</a></code> 
          will utilize and expose the additional information in a number of
          different ways depending on the unique requirements of each
          application use case.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many existing systems do not represent priority values as numeric
          ranges.  Such systems might use fixed, labeled brackets such as
          "<code>low</code>", "<code>normal</code>" and "<code>high</code>" 
          or "<code>urgent</code>".  Similar mechanisms can be
          established, by convention, when using the <code><a>priority</a></code> property.  In
          typical use, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations wishing to work
          with such defined categories treat <code><a>priority</a></code> property values in the
          range <code>0.00</code> to <code>0.25</code> as "<code>low</code>" priority; values 
          greater than <code>0.25</code> to <code>0.75</code> as "<code>normal</code>" priority; 
          and values greater than <code>0.75</code> to <code>1.00</code> as
          "<code>high</code>" priority.  Specific implementations are free to establish
          alternative conventions for the grouping of priority values with the
          caveat that such conventions likely will not be understood by all
          implementations.

        <h2>Audience Targeting Properties</h2>

        <p>
          Every Activity has both a Primary and Secondary audience.  The
          Primary audience consists of those entities either directly involved
          in the performance of the activity or who "own" the objects involved.
          The Secondary audience consists of the collection of entities sharing
          an interest in the activity but who are not directly involved (e.g.
          "followers").
        </p>

        <p>
          For instance, suppose a social network of three individuals: Bob, Joe
          and Jane.  Bob and Joe are each friends with Jane but not friends
          with one another.  Bob has chosen to "follow" activities for which
          Jane is directly involved.  Jane shares a file with Joe.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this example, Jane and Joe are each directly involved in the file
          sharing activity and together make up the Primary Audience for that
          event.  Bob, having an interest in activities involving Jane, is the
          Secondary Audience.  Knowing this, a system that produces or consumes
          the activity can intelligently notify each person of the event.
        </p>

        <p>
          While there are means, based on the verb, actor, object and target of
          the activity, to infer the primary audience for many types of
          activities, those do not work in every case and do not provide a
          means of identifying the secondary audience.  The <code><a>to</a></code>, 
          <code><a>cc</a></code>, <code><a>bto</a></code> and <code><a>bcc</a></code> 
          properties MAY be used within an Activity to explicitly identify the 
          Primary and Secondary audiences.

        <p>
          The prototypical use case for an Activity containing these properties
          is the publication and redistribution of Activities through an
          intermediary.  That is, an event source generates the activity and
          publishes it to the intermediary which determines a subset of events
          to display to specific individual users or groups.  Such a
          determination can be made, in part, by identifying the Primary and
          Secondary Audiences for each activity.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the event source generates the activity and specifies values for
          the <code><a>to</a></code> and <code><a>cc</a></code> fields, the 
          intermediary SHOULD redistribute that event
          with the values of those fields intact, allowing any processor to see
          who the activity has been targeted to.  This is precisely the same
          model used by the <code>to</code> and <code>cc</code> fields in email systems.

        <p>
          There are situations, however, in which disclosing the identity of
          specific members of the audience may be inappropriate.  For instance,
          a user may not wish to let other users know that they are interested
          in various topics, individuals or types of events.  To support this
          option, an event source generating an activity MAY use the 
          <code><a>bto</a></code> and <code><a>bcc</a></code> properties to list 
          entities to whom the activity should be privately targeted.  When an 
          intermediary receives an activity containing these properties, it 
          MUST remove those values prior to redistributing the activity.  The 
          intent is that systems MUST consider entities listed within the 
          <code><a>bto</a></code> and <code><a>bcc</a></code> properties as
          part of the Primary and Secondary audience but MUST NOT disclose that
          fact to any other party.
        </p>

        <p>
          Audience targeting information included within an Activity only
          describes the intent of the activity creator.  With clear exception
          given to the appropriate handling of <code><a>bto</a></code> and 
          <code><a>bcc</a></code>, this specification leaves it up to implementations 
          to determine how the audience targeting information is used.

      <h2><dfn title="Collection" id="collection">Collection</dfn></h2>

      <p>
        Collection objects are a specialization of the base <a>Object</a>
        that contain a listing of other <a title="Object">Objects</a>.
        The Collection object is used primarily as the root of an 
        <a>Activity Streams Document</a>, but can also be used as the
        value of object properties.
      </p>

      <p>
        Collections have both a logical model and a physical serialization.
        While the logical view of a collection might contain a large number
        of objects, any single serialized representation might include only a
        subset of those objects, with specific "paging" <a title="Link Value">Link Values</a> 
        used to reference additional serialized representations that include
        additional subsets.  Such representations are known as "multi-page
        collections", with each serialized subset representing a single
        "page".
      </p>

        Collection objects extend the core <a>Object</a> definition

        <h2>Using collections as summary values</h2>

        <p>
          It is a common practice to use Collection objects to provide summary
          information on the number of specific types of events that have
          occurred with respect to any given object.  For instance, a "<code>note</code>"
          object may have been "shared" or "liked" a number of times by
          different individuals.  In such cases, the Collection object is used
          as a property value with the <code><a>totalItems</a></code> field used 
          to indicate the total number of occurrences, the <code><a>items</a></code> 
          property used to provide details for a subset of the most recent 
          occurrences, and the <code><a>id</a></code> property used to reference 
          a separate Activity Streams document providing additional information.
        </p>

        <p>
          This specification defines the following properties that MAY be used
          within any <a>Object</a> as "summary values":
        </p>

            considered to be replies to the containing object.
          </td>
        </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
          In the following example, the <code><a>replies</a></code> property 
          is used to indicate that a note has 10 responses, and provides 
          information on the most recently received response:

    <h2>Deprecated Activity Streams 1.0 Syntax</h2>

    <p>
      The JSON syntax defined by this specification differs somewhat from
      that defined in the original JSON Activity Streams 1.0
      [[!AS1]] specification in ways that are not backwards
      compatible.  Implementations can choose to continue supporting the
      JSON Activity Streams 1.0 syntax but SHOULD consider it to be
      deprecated.  This means that while implementations MAY continue to
      consume the 1.0 syntax, they SHOULD NOT output the 1.0 syntax unless
      specifically interacting with older non-2.0 compliant
      implementations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Specifically:
    </p>

    <ol>
    <li>
      Implementations MUST use the "<code>application/stream+json</code>" MIME media
      type when producing a JSON serialization using the Activity Streams 1.0
      syntax, and "<code>application/activity+json</code>"
      when producing a serialization conforming to the 2.0 syntax.
    </li>
    <li>
      Implementations that process serializations identified using either 
      the "<code>application/stream+json</code>" or the more
      generic "<code>application/json</code>" MIME media type MUST follow 
      the syntax and processing rules set by [[!AS1]].  The 2.0
      syntax and processing rules apply only when handling
      serializations using the "<code>application/activity+json</code>" media type.
    </li>
    <li>
      This document redefines the <code><a>displayName</a></code>, 
      <code><a>title</a></code>, <code><a>content</a></code> and
      <code><a>summary</a></code> properties as <a title="Natural Language Value">Natural Language Values</a>,
      which means their values can be expressed as either a String or a
      JSON-LD Language Map. In the 1.0 syntax, these are expressed
      solely as String values.  Because the 1.0 values are a valid
      subset allowed by this specification, implementations are not
      required to take any specific action to continue supporting those
      values.
    </li>
    <li>
      This document redefines a large number of common properties
      defined originally as Objects in 1.0 as <a title="Link Value">Link Values</a>.
      This means the property values can be expressed
      as either an IRI String, an <a>Object</a>, or an Array of IRI Strings
      and Objects.  Because the 1.0 values are a valid subset allowed
      by this specification, implementations are not required to take
      any specific action to continue supporting those values.
    </li>
    <li>
      This specification replaces the <code>upstreamDuplicates</code> and
      <code>downstreamDuplicates</code> properties defined in the 1.0 syntax with
      a singular <code>duplicates</code> property with a <a>Link Value</a>.
      The <code>upstreamDuplicates</code> and <code>downstreamDuplicates</code> property
      values in 1.0 are defined as Arrays of strings.  Implementations
      MUST consider the union of these two values as an alias for the
      <code>duplicates</code> property. Implementations of the 2.0 syntax
      SHOULD NOT use the deprecated <code>upstreamDuplicates</code> and 
      <code>downstreamDuplicates</code> properties.
    </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      By following these requirements, all JSON Activity Streams 1.0
      serializations can be processed successfully by 2.0 implementations.

  <section id="id-value-comparison">

    <h2>Comparison of Identifier Values</h2>

    <p>
      The values of <code><a>id</a></code> properties can be compared to determine if the
      identifiers represent duplicate content.  The values MUST be compared
      on a character-by-character, case-sensitive basis.  Comparisons MUST
      be based solely on the character strings themselves and MUST NOT rely
      on dereferencing the IRIs or URIs mapped from them.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a consequence, two IRIs that resolve to the same resource but are
      not character-for-character identical will be considered different
      for the purposes of identifier comparison.  In such cases, the
      <code><a>duplicates</a></code> property can be used to expressly relate such objects to
      one another.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section id="extensibility">

    <h2>Extensibility</h2>

    <p>
      Processors that encounter unfamiliar properties within any
      <a>Object</a> MUST NOT stop processing or signal an error and MUST
      continue processing the items as if those properties were not
      present.
    </p>

    <section id="extension-types">

      <h2>Extension verbs and objectTypes</h2>

      <p>
        Verb and objectType identifiers are expressed in one of two ways:
        either as a simple token value matching the "<code>isegment-nz-nc</code>"
        production in [[RFC3987]] or as an absolute IRI.  When expressed as an
        IRI, it is RECOMMENDED that the final component (either the last path
        segment or fragment identifier) conforms to the "<code>isegment-nz-nc</code>"
        production as well.  For instance, "<code>http://example.org/verbs/like</code>" or
        "<code>http://example.org/verbs#like</code>".
      </p>

      <p>
        When selecting a verb identifier that is a direct equivalent to a
        natural language verb or action, it is RECOMMENDED that the final
        <code>isegment-nz-nc</code> token is expressed as the "infinitive" or 
        "base" form of the natural language verb, without indication of 
        linguistic tense, mood or aspect.  For example, the verb identifier 
        "<code>http://example.org/verbs/share</code>" is preferable to 
        alternative forms like "<code>http://example.org/verbs/shared</code>" 
        or "<code>http://example.org/verbs/sharing</code>".
      </p>

      <p>
        Verb identifiers may also be idiomatic in nature.  For example, an
        activity such as "Joe flagged the post as inappropriate", could be
        expressed using an idiomatic verb "<code>flag-as-inappropriate</code>":
      </p>

      <figure><figcaption></figcaption>
<pre class="example highlight json">{
  "actor": "acct:joe@example.org",
  "verb": "flag-as-inappropriate",
  "object": "http://example.org/posts/1"
}</pre></figure>

      <p>
        In such cases, the verb identifier may not necessarily correlate a
        single discrete linguistic verb infinitive, but SHOULD still be
        expressed in the infinitive form (e.g. "<code>flag-as-inappropriate</code>" as
        opposed to "<code>flagged-as-inappropriate</code>").
      </p>

      <p>
        When selecting an objectType identifier that is a direct equivalent
        to a natural language common noun, it is RECOMMENDED that the final
        <code>isegment-nz-nc</code> token is expressed in terms of a singular instance of
        the object.  For example, the objectType identifier 
        "<code>http://example.org/objects#bird</code>" is preferable to 
        "<code>http://example.org/objects#birds</code>".
      </p>

      <p>
        The objectType identifier MUST NOT be used to identify specific
        individual instances of a class of object -- for instance, it would
        never be appropriate to have <code>"<a>objectType</a>": "acct:joe@example.org"</code>,
        even though the value "<code>acct:joe@example.org</code>" is a valid absolute IRI.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note, finally, that verb and objectType identifiers are not dependent
        on language context.  That is, while the natural language verbs
        "speak" (English) and "hablar" (Spanish) are equivalent natural
        language translations, they are not considered to be equivalent verb
        identifiers.  Implementations are free to
        treat such variations as equivalent but doing so is considered beyond
        the scope of this specification.

      <h2>Using JSON-LD to Extend and Process Activity Streams Documents</h2>

      <p>
        The JSON-based Serialization for Linked Data
        [[!JSON-LD]] describes a rich syntax for the
        serialization of semantically-rich metadata using the JSON format.
        While the updated Activity Streams representation provided by this
        document is not defined strictly as a "JSON-LD Vocabulary", the
        syntax is designed to be closely compatible with JSON-LD.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are a few differences between JSON-LD and the serialization
        syntax described here, specifically:
      </p>

      <ul>
      <li>
        JSON-LD uses certain field names with a leading "@" character,
        such as "<code>@id</code>" and "<code>@language</code>".  In 
        this specification, the leading "@" is omitted.
      </li>
      <li>
        While JSON-LD allows using relative IRI references in the values
        of <code><a>id</a></code> properties, this specification limits 
        identifiers to absolute IRIs.
      </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When processing an Activity Streams document as JSON-LD, the
        following rules apply:
      </p>

      <ul>
      <li>
        The <code><a>objectType</a></code> property MUST be treated as an alias of JSON-LD
        "<code>@type</code>".  When the objectType property is expressed using an
        object value, the value object's <code><a>id</a></code> property is used to express
        the "<code>@type</code>".
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code><a>id</a></code> property MUST be treated as an alias of 
        JSON-LD "<code>@id</code>".
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code><a>language</a></code> property MUST be treated as an alias of JSON-LD
        "<code>@language</code>".
      </li>
      <li>
        A JSON array used to convey <a title="Link Value">Link Values</a> MUST be
        treated as an unordered JSON-LD <code>@set</code> (<code>@container = @set</code>).
      </li>
      <li>
        The JSON array value for the <code><a>items</a></code> property defined in
        Section 3.7 MUST be treated as an ordered JSON-LD <code>@list</code>
        (<code>@container = @list</code>).
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code><a>displayName</a></code>, <code><a>title</a></code>, 
        <code><a>content</a></code> and <code><a>summary</a></code> properties
        defined in Section 3.1 and Section 3.6 MUST be treated as JSON-LD
        Language Maps (<code>@container = @language</code>).
      </li>
      <li>
        The base URI for all property names defined within this
        specification MUST be set to "<code>http://activitystrea.ms/2.0/</code>".  For
        instance, when processed as JSON-LD, the <code><a>displayName</a></code> property
        expands to "<code>http://activitystrea.ms/2.0/displayName</code>"; while the
        <code><a>endTime</a></code> property expands to "<code>http://activitystrea.ms/2.0/endTime</code>".
      </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A non-normative JSON-LD <code>@context</code> document covering the Activity
        Streams 2.0 model is provided in Appendix B.
      </p>

      <section id="compact-iris">
        <h2>Handling of JSON-ID Compact IRIs</h2>

        <p>
          In JSON-LD, a "Compact IRI" is a type of shorthand notation that
          allows absolute IRI values to be split into an absolute base IRI and
          a relative token.  For instance, in the following example:
        </p>

        <figure><figcaption></figcaption>
<pre class="example highlight json">{
  "@context": {
    "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"
  },
  "foaf:givenName": "Sam"
}</pre></figure>

        <p>
          The property name <code>foaf:givenName</code> is a Compact IRI that expands to
          "<code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/givenName</code>" when processed by a JSON-LD
          implementation.
        </p>

        <p>
          While there are differences of opinion on how extensively Compact
          IRIs ought to be used within JSON-LD document instances, JSON-LD
          implementations are required to support them.  To an Activity Streams
          2.0 implementation that does not perform JSON-LD processing, Compact
          IRIs are treated exactly like any other form of extension markup and
          MAY be ignored.
        </p>

        <p>
          Use of Compact IRIs by non-JSON-LD compliant implementations SHOULD
          be avoided, however, if such implementations do choose to process
          Compact IRIs, the following prefix mappings SHOULD be applied:

  <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Publishers or Consumers implementing Activity Streams as a stream of
    public data may also want to consider the potential for unsolicited
    commercial or malicious content and should take preventative measures
    to recognize such content and either identify it or not include it in
    their implementations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Publishers should take reasonable measures to ensure potentially
    malicious user input such as cross-site scripting attacks are not
    included in the Activity Streams data they publish.
  </p>

  <p>
    Consumers that re-emit ingested content to end-users MUST take
    reasonable measures if emitting ingested content to make sure
    potentially malicious ingested input is not re-emitted.
  </p>

  <p>
    Consumers that re-emit ingested content for crawling by search
    engines should take reasonable measures to limit any use of their
    site as a Search Engine Optimization loophole.  This may include
    converting untrusted hyperlinks to text or including a
    rel="nofollow" attribute.
  </p>

  <p>
    Consumers should be aware of the potential for spoofing attacks where
    the attacker publishes activities or objects with falsified property
    values with the intent of injecting malicious content, hiding or
    corrupting legitimate content, or misleading users.
  </p>

  <p>
    Activity Streams are JSON Documents and are subject to the same
    security considerations described in [[!RFC4627]].

    <h2>Linguistic Forms</h2>

    <p>
      The Activity Streams format has been intentionally designed to be
      flexible in how machine-readable statements about past, present or 
      future actions can be expressed. Implementations will often translate
      Activity Statements into human-readable sentences such as 
      "John uploaded a file" or "John will upload a file". To make such
      transformations possible, it is necessary for implementations to 
      have some sense of how the machine-readable JSON serialization 
      maps to common natural-language linguistic forms.
    </p>

    <section id="intransitive">
      <h2>Intransitive Activity</h2>

      <p>
        In many situations, the <code><a>actor</a></code> of an Activity also 
        serves as the direct object.  For example, if I say, 
        "The process terminated", then the "process" is both the actor and the 
        object.  Such statements are formally known as being "intransitive".
      </p>

      <figure><figcaption>To describe intransitive activities,
        simply omit the <code><a>object</a></code> property:</figcaption>
<pre class="example highlight json">{
  "actor": {
    "objectType": "process",
    "displayName": "Build Process"
  },
  "verb": "terminate"
}</pre></figure>

    </section>

    <section id="transitive">
      <h2>Transitive Activity</h2>

      <p>
        In a "transitive" activity, the actor and direct object are distinct
        entities.  This is the form most commonly expressed using the
        Activity Streams format.  For instance, if I say, "Joe posted a blog
        entry", the actor is "Joe" and the "blog entry" is the direct object.
      </p>

      <figure><figcaption>Transitive activities contain distinct <code><a>actor</a></code> and 
      <code><a>object</a></code> properties:</figcaption>
<pre class="example highlight json">{
  "actor": "acct:joe@example.org",
  "verb": "post",

      <h2>Ditransitive Activity</h2>

      <p>
        In "ditransitive" activities, there exist distinct actor, direct and
        indirect objects.  The indirect object specifies the target to which
        the action on the direct object has been directed.  For instance, in
        "Joe posted a blog entry to his Weblog", the indirect object (or
        "target") is "Joe's Weblog".
      </p>

      <figure><figcaption>Ditransitive activities contain <code><a>actor</a></code>, 
      <code><a>object</a></code>, and <code><a>target</a></code> properties.</figcaption>

     <section id="tense-and-aspect">

      <h2>Expressing tense and aspect</h2>

      <p>
        By using the <code><a>startTime</a></code>, <code><a>endTime</a></code>, 
        <code><a>duration</a></code> and <code><a>status</a></code>
        properties, Activity statements can be used to express past, present
        or future actions.  Implementations should never rely on an activity
        statement's verb identifier to determine the tense or aspect of the
        action.
      </p>

      <figure><figcaption>To indicate an activity that has already concluded, the
        startTime and endTime properties would be used to indicate past
        points in time</figcaption>
<pre class="example highlight json">{
  "actor": "acct:joe@example.org",
  "verb": "post",
  "object": "http://example.org/blog/entry/1",
  "startTime": "2012-12-12T12:12:12Z",
  "endTime": "2012-12-12T12:12:12Z"
}</pre></figure>

        <figure><figcaption>If specific start and end times for a concluded activity are not
        available, the <code><a>status</a></code> property can be used to expressly indicate
        that the action has completed:</figcaption>

  "actor": "acct:joe@example.org",
  "verb": "post",
  "object": "http://example.org/blog/entry/1",
  "status": "completed"
}</pre></figure>

      <figure><figcaption>To indicate an activity that began in the past but is still ongoing,
        only the <code><a>startTime</a></code> property would be used:</figcaption>
<pre class="example highlight json">{
  "actor": "acct:joe@example.org",
  "verb": "watch",
  "object": "http://movies.example.org/movie/1",
  "startTime": "2014-03-18T04:32:43Z"
}</pre></figure>
        
      <figure><figcaption>The status property value "<code>active</code>" can also be used to identify
        ongoing activities:</figcaption>
<pre class="example highlight json">{
  "actor": "acct:joe@example.org",
  "verb": "watch",
  "object": "http://movies.example.org/movie/1",
  "status": "active"
}</pre></figure>

      <figure><figcaption>To indicate an activity that is expected to begin in the future, the
        <code><a>startTime</a></code> property would indicate a future point in time:</figcaption>
<pre class="example highlight json">{
  "actor": "acct:joe@example.org",
  "verb": "cook",
  "object": "http://recipes.example.org/recipe/1",
  "startTime": "2015-12-23T12:34:21Z"
}</pre></figure>

      <figure><figcaption>Or, alternatively:</figcaption>
<pre class="example highlight json">{
  "actor": "acct:joe@example.org",
  "verb": "cook",
  "object": "http://recipes.example.org/recipe/1",
  "status": "pending"
}</pre></figure>

      <p>
        The status values "<code>pending</code>" and "<code>tentative</code>" 
        differ in that the former is used to mark actions that are expected to 
        happen while the latter is used to mark proposed actions that may 
        (or may not) happen.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an alternative to explicitly stating the <code><a>startTime</a></code> 
        or <code><a>endTime</a></code> properties, the <code><a>duration</a></code> property 
        can be used to indicate a specific duration of time relative to either 
        the <code><a>startTime</a></code> or <code><a>endTime</a></code>.  
        For instance, specifying an <code><a>endTime</a></code> of
        "<code>2015-12-23T12:23:23Z</code>" with a <code><a>duration</a></code> of "<code>PT1H</code>", 
        implies a starting time of exactly "<code>2015-12-23T11:23:23Z</code>" (1 hour before the specified
        ending time).
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that the value of the <code><a>duration</a></code> property can be expressed
        either as a non-negative integer specifying a number of seconds, or
        as an [[!RFC3339]] <code>duration</code> string such as "<code>PT1H</code>", "<code>P1DT1H</code>", etc.  For
        Activity Streams 2.0 implementations for which backwards
        compatibility with the Activity Streams 1.0 syntax is not critical,
        the RFC 3339 string format is strongly recommended.

    <section id="activity-duration">

      <h2>Activity Duration</h2>

      <p>
        Actions expressed via the Activity Streams format can either be
        instantaneous (semelfactive) or durative (having distinct start and
        end times).  The specific duration of an activity can be optionally
        expressed using the <code><a>startTime</a></code>, <code><a>endTime</a></code> 
        and <code><a>duration</a></code> properties.
      </p>

      <p>
        By default, all activities are assumed to occur instantaneously, that
        is, occuring at one point in time without any specific duration.
        Such events are indicated by omitting the <code><a>startTime</a></code>, 
        <code><a>endTime</a></code> or <code><a>duration</a></code> properties:

      <p>
        An activity that occurs within a specific period of time can be
        expressed using combinations of either: <code><a>startTime</a></code> 
        and <code><a>endTime</a></code>, <code><a>startTime</a></code> and 
        <code><a>duration</a></code>, or <code><a>endTime</a></code> and
